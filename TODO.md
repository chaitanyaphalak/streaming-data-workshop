# TODOs

- [ ] Change Infinispan template application name to `datagrid`
- [ ] Set `developer/developer` as MGMT user/password by default in template
- [ ] Run everything from Google Cloud Shell
- [ ] Secure OpenShift with a custom credentials
(ideally random developer and admin user/pwd).
The aim is to avoid attacks.
- [ ] Remove big files and compact repo size.
Use: [bfg-repo-cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner).
Binaries should be stored in Google Cloud Storage or similar.
Then, consume them from the application.
